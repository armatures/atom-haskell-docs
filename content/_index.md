## IRC Chat

You can join #atom-haskell on FreeNode, and devs can usually be found there. Bear in mind that if someone's on the channel, it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't AFK.

If you're not familiar with IRC, you can use [FreeNode's webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#atom-haskell)

## Gitter Chat

We also have a Gitter chat room on https://gitter.im/atom-haskell/ide-haskell
